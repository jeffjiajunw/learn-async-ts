- Extract the code in the setTimeout function and replace the setTimeout function  with the extracted code. Then run the main script. 
- Is there a difference in the flow of execution from when the code was in the setTimeout function?
- Is the flow of execution in both these examples different from the flow of execution with the examples using the fetch() API, which also returns a promise? 
- If yes, explain the code execution difference. Add your explanation to this file.

There is a difference in flow. With "settimeout", the summing is deferred, but with "settimeiut", the summing logic executes immediately as part of the promise

They are different. Fetch depends on network response and this flow happens or in the next event loop cycle, causing time difference.
